Plug-And-Play Dynamic Website - Automated, dynamic website 
based on third party user data 
VC Track

1. Goals / Motivation
Most websites (especially SMB + Shopify stores) run the same homepage and landing pages for every visitor — even though visitors arrive with different intents.
Examples:
“I want to buy a 4K gaming monitor now”
“I’m researching best monitors for work”
“I’m comparing brands/prices”
Big enterprises solve this with expensive personalization tools and analytics teams. SMBs can’t.
Goal: Build a plug-and-play personalization layer that any website can install in minutes, and that uses AI to pick the right template variant + images + messages per visitor intent.
Goal
Create an AI-first widget / snippet that:
Works on any website (Shopify, Webflow, custom sites)
Requires minimal setup
Detects user intent from context signals
Selects from a finite set of templates + assets
Swaps hero image, headline, CTA, and optionally section order
Provides a “why this variant” explanation for debugging and trust
This is not “generate a new website”.
This is safe, templatized personalization.
Pick one domain to demo, but make the mechanism generic.
Recommended demo domain: E-commerce (Monitors store)
Visitors arrive with intents like:
Buy Now (“buy 27 inch 4k monitor”)
Compare (“best monitor 2026 comparison”)
Use Case (“monitor for gaming / coding / design”)
Budget (“cheap 144hz monitor”)
Your system should show clearly different hero experiences per intent.
2. Features
2.1 Plug-and-Play Install (must feel Shopify-ready)
Provide one of:
A single script tag that can be pasted into any site
A “mock Shopify app” install flow (simulated) that injects the script
A simple “copy this snippet” embed
Must work on a static demo page with no backend required
Setup should be < 5 minutes
2.2 Templatized Variants (finite inventory)
Define a Template Registry with at least:
3 hero templates (same layout, different content slots)
Each template has slots:
hero image
headline
subheadline
CTA label + link target
Example template:
HeroTemplateA(image, headline, subheadline, cta_text, cta_link)
2.3 Asset Library (pictures are mandatory)
Create an asset library with at least:
6 images (e.g., gaming setup, office desk, design studio, price-focused graphic, etc.)
Optional: 3 icon sets / badges (“Free Shipping”, “Warranty”, “Best Seller”)
AI must choose images based on intent, not randomly.
2.4 Intent Detection (2+ signals)
Infer intent from at least two of:
URL query / UTM parameters
referrer type (Google vs social vs email)
on-page behavior (scroll/click in first 5 seconds) — simulated ok
a “persona” toggle for demo
2.5 Decision Engine (must be explainable)
AI must decide at minimum:
which hero template to use
which hero image to show
which CTA to prioritize (Buy / Compare / Explore)
✅ Must output a structured decision object like:
{
  "intent": "COMPARE",
  "template": "Hero_B",
  "hero_image": "img_gaming_vs_office.jpg",
  "cta": "Compare models",
  "reason": "Query contains 'best' + 'vs' signals comparison intent."

2.6 Personalization Injection (front-end)
On page load, your script:
determines context
queries decision engine (local rules or API)
swaps assets/text in DOM safely
logs what happened (for demo)

Constraints (Very Important)
No chatbot as the main UX
No full page generation end-to-end
Must use finite templates + finite assets
Must be installable via snippet
Must be safe: fallback to default content

3. Optional Extensions (Stretch Goals)
Teams are encouraged (but not required) to explore advanced features such as:
Lightweight event tracking (clicks on CTA, add-to-cart, “compare” clicks)
A/B exploration mode (try 2 variants, pick winner)
Multi-page support (homepage + product page hero)
“Preview mode” for site owners: simulate intents and see variants
4. Hints and Resources
Frontend: simple HTML/React + DOM mutation
“Install”: script injection pattern
Decision engine can be:
rules + LLM (best)
pure rules (acceptable for MVP)
Store template registry as JSON
5. Why Does It Matter?
This is the smallest wedge into a massive market:
personalization for the long tail (Shopify/SMBs), not just enterprises.
If plug-and-play personalization becomes easy and safe, it becomes:
a default growth lever for every small business
an “AI Stripe for website experiences”
